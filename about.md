The One Hour Challenge is a coding experiment of the greatest kind...<br/>
Where less is more.<br/>
Suited for the "I already work 40 hours a week and have a social life" kind of person.<br/>
Great for small attention spans.<br/>

How it works:

1. Pick a technology that we have never used before
2. Set a timer for 1 hour
3. Build
4. Deploy
5. Reflect
