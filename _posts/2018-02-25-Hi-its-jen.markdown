Tonight we completed our first one hour challenge. Our first technology... Angular 5. Go big or go home right?! We certainly thought so.

Setting up our dev environment was not an easy feat. It took close to 7 minutes to download angular-cli. Perhaps this could be my shaking internet, bouncing between 4 and 8 Megabits per second. Regardless, expect a heavy set up. Add another 5 minutes to build boiler plate hello-world app (ng new my-app).

This prompted the decision to give ourselves pre-challenge 15 minutes to set up the dev environment.

We began by perusing the project's file structure...

First reactions:
- Similar to React in its ideas of components and binding
- Heavy file structure

We followed the first bits of Angular's getting started tutorial, "angular-tour-of-heroes", but didn't get far enough to  figure out even why there were heroes.

We added a new component, wrote some awesome inline css, and tried to fit a module inside a component.

Final reactions:
- There is a lot of magic happening. We attempted to explore and fuel the curiosity-- what is ng serve? how is it rendering the page? what is a directive? What is a module? Can there be more than one @ngModule? How about @ngApp? It was a rabbit hole indeed.
- Which leads me to the next reaction, complicated terminology

- Syntax is not intuitive. It doesn't match JavaScript, Java, or React.
- Typescript... Didn't expect that one.

Post-Challenge conversation:
When talking frontend frameworks, is opionated better? Do opionated frameworks scale better? Work better for larger teams?
