excerpt: "Setting up a free SSL Certificate on personal websites - 1 hour challenge + how-to guide"
---

This week's one hour challenge involved getting a free SSL certificate for my personal website. Why SSL? Well first, I wanted one of those little green locks with the word "Secure" next to my url. I felt like this would legitimize my website and I am expanding it to include a blog and static resources like presentation slides. I also been considering refactoring it to use a frontend framework like React, Preact, or Vue.js. Getting an SSL Certificate felt like a good first step in this journey. After finding the right tool for the job, Cloudflare (it was recommended by a friend; I floundered for a few days before connecting with this friend), the set up was quick and easy.

Technology:
Site is hosted on [Github Pages] :https://pages.github.com/
Domain purchased on mydomain.com
[Cloudflare] :https://www.cloudflare.com/ provided the SSL certificate
